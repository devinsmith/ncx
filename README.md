# ncx

A small, simple, terminal chat client with minimal dependencies.

After connecting make sure to type ".help" or name yourself with ".n myname".

# Building

Assuming you have a C++ compiler and some variant of Linux/BSD, just type `make`

The `ncx` binary will then be built and ready to run.
